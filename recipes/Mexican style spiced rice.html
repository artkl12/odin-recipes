  <h3>How to prepare</h3>
  <p>One-pan is all it takes to make this Mexican-style spiced rice. A mixture of bacon and chipotle paste stirred through the rice gives it the dish a real savoury smack.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>4 rashers streaky bacon, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
    <li>1 celery stick, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 mixed peppers, deseeded and sliced</li>
    <li>200g long-grain rice, rinsed</li>
    <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>Â½ reduced-salt chicken stock cube, made up to 225ml</li>
    <li>1 tbsp chipotle chilli paste</li>
    <li>1 red chilli, sliced and deseeded (if you like)</li>
    <li>15g fresh coriander, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 lime, cut into wedges to serve</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large, lidded frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the bacon. Fry for 3-5 mins until golden and cooked through, then transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon, leaving the oil in the pan.</li>
    <li>Add the onion, garlic, celery and peppers to the pan and cook for 5 mins. Add the rice, tomatoes and stock. Bring to the boil, then cover, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-18 mins, until the rice is tender.</li>
    <li>Stir the bacon and chipotle paste through the rice; season to taste. Divide between 4 plates, garnish with the chilli and coriander and serve with the lime wedges to squeeze over.</li>
